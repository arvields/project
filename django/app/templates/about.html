                    <p>
                        <br><br>The primary objective of this classification system is to employ a knowledge base, decision tables, and
                         a decision tree algorithm for the morphological classification of Indo-Pacific coastal fish
                         ichthyoplankton. This system aims to automate the classification method for ichthyoplankton, grouping
                         them into their respective categories, genus, and families based on meristic measurements and sample
                         characteristics.
                         <br><br>
                         Utilizing a decision tree algorithm within a questionnaire connected to the knowledge base, the system 
                         will initially provide a classification result and then generate the final classification in the scorecard using 
                         decision tables. Our proposed solution seeks to suggest or generate fish groups, families, and genus 
                         aligned with specified parameters, offering a practical and efficient tool for marine biologists, fisheries 
                         scientists, and other stakeholders involved in ichthyoplankton classification. 
                         <br><br>
                         This system's objective is to advance automated classification methods, simplifying the classification of 
                         ichthyoplankton groups, families, and genus.

                    <h2>Specific Objectives of the System</h2>
                    <p1>
                        The specific objective of this classification system that incorporates a knowledge base, decision tables, 
                        and a decision tree algorithm is to efficiently classify ichthyoplankton into their respective groups, 
                        families, and genus based on morphological features and meristic characters/measurements. This system 
                        is designed to eliminate the need for machine learning expertise, leveraging decision tables and a 
                        decision tree algorithm for effective classification.
                        <br><br>
                        At the heart of this endeavor is an intelligent questionnaire, seamlessly integrating data entry, 
                        calculation, and classification into a unified and streamlined process. This novel approach aims to 
                        improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and automate the classification process, ultimately delivering a 
                        quicker and more effective outcome for users.
                        <br><br>
                        The knowledge base functions as a digital repository, housing data on the morphometrics and meristic 
                        characteristics of the ichthyoplankton fish group, family, and genusâ€”resembling an electronic version of 
                        the reference book by Jeffrey M. Leis and Brooke M. Carson-Ewart used by the study group.
                        <br><br>
                        The decision tree algorithm analyzes recorded data and conducts the classification process within the 
                        questionnaire and knowledge base, transforming the questionnaire into an intelligent tool. The resulting 
                        outputs include displaying the shape characteristic and group number to which the specimen belongs, 
                        along with presenting potential candidate families as the initial step in the classification.
                        <br><br>
                        To score the morphometric and meristic values, particularly in determining candidate fish families and 
                        narrowing down options, a decision table is employed. The decision table provides a structured and clear 
                        representation of rules, facilitating a transparent interpretation of the classification process leading to the 
                        final result.
